# Dashboard

## Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to familiarize with the software platform we have chosen (nodejs) through the creation of a dashboard.
To do this, we need to implement a web application that works like [Netvibes](https://www.netvibes.com/fr).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
Make sure that `.env.example` is renamed in `.env` in the client directory

### `./exec.sh`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [https://172.18.0.2:3000](https://172.18.0.2:3000) to view it in the browser.
