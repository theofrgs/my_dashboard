# Dashboard

## Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to familiarize with the software platform we have chosen (nodejs) through the creation of a dashboard.
To do this, we need to implement a web application that works like [Netvibes](https://www.netvibes.com/fr).

## Prerequisites

Before running any script, make sure that:

`.example.env` is renamed in `.env` in the client directory, 

`mariadb_config.json.exemple` is renamed in `.mariadb_config.json` in the server directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `./exec.sh`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Click on the link in your console, once the deployement is finished to view it in the browser.

## Content

The dashboard has 4 services with 7 widgets: Currency, weather, Nasa and Spotify.

Each widget is refreshed after a 30 seconds delay.

## Learn More

This project was built using react for its front-end technology and express for its back-end.

The documentation for this project is available here : [Documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Bapt7/default-title/0.1#/)
